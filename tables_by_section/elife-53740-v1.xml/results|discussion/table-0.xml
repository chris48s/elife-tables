Asterisks show classes of complexes that were identified with lower confidence. PSII densities are dimers, and thus the monomeric stoichiometry of PSII/PSI is 2.14. Densities that could correspond to free PSII monomers were seldom observed in membranograms and thus were not assigned.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
