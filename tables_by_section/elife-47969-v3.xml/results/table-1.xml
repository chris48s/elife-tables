<table-wrap xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Composition, enrichment analysis, and grouping characteristics of the clusters found by comparison of each participant&#8217;s pre- and post-challenge time series of FeNO.</title><p>Enrichment is marked in bold letters, depletion in italics; the corresponding p-values were calculated using the hypergeometric test. The empirical p-values for the proportion of pre- and post-pairs were calculated using simulated permutations (see Materials&#160;and&#160;methods section). A participant is fully represented in a given cluster if both their pre- and post-challenge time series of measurements are contained in the cluster. For example, the healthy participant &#8216;P08H&#8217; is fully represented in Cluster 2, as both their pre- and post-challenge time series of FeNO measurements are members of Cluster 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> below). Partial representation corresponds to the scenario in which only one of the two time series (pre- and post-challenge) is a member of the cluster. For instance, the asthmatic participant " P07A&#8217; is only partially represented in Cluster 2, because their pre-challenge time series of FeNO measurements is part of Cluster 2, whereas their post-challenge time series of FeNO belongs to Cluster 3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> below).
