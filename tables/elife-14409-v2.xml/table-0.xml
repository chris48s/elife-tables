As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hose et al. (2015)</xref>, RPKM normalization produced data that agreed as well or better across replicates compared to spike-in normalization and in the case of YJM428_Chr16-4n agreed better with qPCR measurements of Chr16 abundance in the culture (not shown). Note data from NCYC110 replicate (rep) 5 were not used in the analysis but were generated during the Hose <italic>et al.</italic> manuscript revision stage for normalization controls. The SD of DNA ratios on the affected chromosome that were subtracted from gene-level measurements of relative DNA abundance (i.e. to generate the gene-specific thresholds, see text) are shown for reference where relevant.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
