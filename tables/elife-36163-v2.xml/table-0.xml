Most of the papers (95.7%; 156/163) did not report the t-statistic (column 2) and over two-thirds (69.3%; 113/163) did not report exact p-values (column 4), but over three-quarters (76.7%; 125/163) reported the exact sample size or degree of freedom for all of the t-tests in the paper (column 3).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
