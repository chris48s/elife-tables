The target was missed if a reach was executed but did not land within the acceptance window. Delay violations occurred if above-threshold hand velocity was detected between target onset and the go cue. This could occur if the monkey made an overt reach or a small adjustment. Trials were also failed if hand velocity was above threshold during the interval from the go cue until 100 ms later. Changes in hand velocity during this time are unlikely to reflect legitimate responses to the go cue, and were thus treated the same way as movement during the delay. Movement during the target-hold period (after it was successfully hit) also resulted in a failure. This occurred if velocity exceeded threshold, or if hand position exited the acceptance window. The maximum RT (500 ms for cue-initiated, 1500 ms for self-initiated) elapsed if the hand never moved. Such failures tended to happen if the monkey became distracted during a trial, or near the end of the day as motivation waned. For example, simply holding the hand on the screen but not performing the task resulted in such failures being recorded. Violations of the maximum movement duration occurred if the hand left the touch-point but did not land on the target within 500 ms. This could occur for very sluggish movements, or if the monkey simply aborted the trial and did not attempt to hit the target. We also included in this category failures in the quasi-automatic context where the hand did not land back on the screen before the target disappeared off the screen.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="3" valign="top">Monkey ba</th><th colspan="3" valign="top">Monkey ax</th></tr><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Cue-initiated</th><th valign="top">Self-initiated</th><th valign="top">Quasi-automatic</th><th valign="top">Cue-initiated</th><th valign="top">Self-initiated</th><th valign="top">Quasi-automatic</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Missed target</td><td valign="top">1.4%</td><td valign="top">4.1%</td><td valign="top">3.3%</td><td valign="top">0.9%</td><td valign="top">1.6%</td><td valign="top">2.4%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Delay violation <break/>(adjustment or overt reach)</td><td valign="top">2.2%</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">1.3%</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Velocity violation within 100 ms <break/>of go cue (adjustment <break/>or non-physiological RT)</td><td valign="top">1.6%</td><td valign="top">0.1%</td><td valign="top">0.6%</td><td valign="top">1.1%</td><td valign="top">0%</td><td valign="top">0.5%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Moved during <break/>target-hold period</td><td valign="top">1.4%</td><td valign="top">1.3%</td><td valign="top">2.1%</td><td valign="top">1.5%</td><td valign="top">1.2%</td><td valign="top">1.1%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Max RT elapsed</td><td valign="top">2.2%</td><td valign="top">2.6%</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">0.8%</td><td valign="top">0.6%</td><td valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Max movement <break/>duration elapsed</td><td valign="top">0.2%</td><td valign="top">0.2%</td><td valign="top">1.3% <break/>(target left screen)</td><td valign="top">0.1%</td><td valign="top">0.2%</td><td valign="top">2.7% <break/>(target left screen)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
