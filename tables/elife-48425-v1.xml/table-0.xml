We recognize that, in other contexts, pre-tenure faculty may also categorized as ECRs.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Co-reviewing</td><td valign="top">Contributing ideas and/or text to a peer review report when one is not the invited reviewer. Equivalent to a co-author on a manuscript when one is not the corresponding author. <break/><italic>Note</italic>: We use this term to mean significant contributions to the peer review report, and so differentiate from casual or insignificant conversations about the manuscript under review that do not provide novel ideas and/or text to the peer review report.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ghostwriting</td><td valign="top">Co-reviewing without named credit to the journal editorial staff. <break/><italic>Note</italic>: We use this term to mean <underline>only</underline> the identification of a co-reviewer to the journal staff in an identical manner to the identification and naming of the invited reviewers.
