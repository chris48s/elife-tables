Implement, as a matter of priority, scientific advice for protecting habitat and/or preventing overfishing of chondrichthyan populations;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;2. Draft and implement Plans of Action pursuant to the International Plan Of Action (IPOA&#8211;Sharks), which include, wherever possible, binding, science-based management measures for chondrichthyans and their essential habitats;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;3. Significantly increase observer coverage, monitoring, and enforcement in fisheries taking chondrichthyans;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;4. Require the collection and accessibility of species-specific chondrichthyan fisheries data, including discards, and penalize non-compliance;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;5. Conduct population assessments for chondrichthyans;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;6. Implement and enforce chondrichthyan fishing limits in accordance with scientific advice; when sustainable catch levels are uncertain, set limits based on the precautionary approach;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;7. Strictly protect chondrichthyans deemed exceptionally vulnerable through Ecological Risk Assessments and those classified by IUCN as Critically Endangered or Endangered;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;8. Prohibit the removal of shark fins while onboard fishing vessels and thereby require the landing of sharks with fins naturally attached; and,</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;9. Promote research on gear modifications, fishing methods, and habitat identification aimed at mitigating chondrichthyan bycatch and discard mortality.</td></tr><tr><td>National governments are urged to:</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;10. Propose and work to secure RFMO management measures based on scientific advice and the precautionary approach;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;11. Promptly and accurately report species-specific chondrichthyan landings to relevant national and international authorities;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;12. Take unilateral action to implement domestic management for fisheries taking chondrichthyans, including precautionary limits and/or protective status where necessary, particularly for species classified by IUCN as Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered, and encourage similar actions by other Range States;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;13. Adopt bilateral fishery management agreements for shared chondrichthyan populations;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;14. Ensure active membership in Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS), RFMOs, and other relevant regional and international agreements;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;15. Fully implement and enforce CITES chondrichthyan listings based on solid non-detriment findings, if trade in listed species is allowed;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;16. Propose and support the listing of additional threatened chondrichthyan species under CITES and CMS and other relevant wildlife conventions;</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;17. Collaborate on regional agreements and the CMS migratory shark Memorandum of Understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">CMS, 2010</xref>), with a focus on securing concrete conservation actions; and,</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;18. Strictly enforce chondrichthyan fishing and protection measures and impose meaningful penalties for violations.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
