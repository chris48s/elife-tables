The higher the mean value calculated for the group, the closer the group feels to disagreeing with statement. &#8220;No opinion&#8221; responses, coded as 3, are included in these means. A 2-tailed student&#8217;s t-test for equality of the means was used to calculate p values. Due to the difference in the percentage of ECRs and PIs with "no opinion" for the third question, we removed "no opinion" responses and recalculated the mean scores: the difference between the mean scores was reduced but remained significant (ECRs: 1.57&#160;&#177;&#160;0.05 (n&#160;=&#160;365); PIs: 1.88&#160;&#177;&#160;0.15 (n&#160;=&#160;64); p=0.048).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Statement</th><th valign="top">ECR Mean Score</th><th valign="top">PI Mean Score</th><th valign="top"><italic>p</italic> value</th><th valign="top">% ECRs with no opinion</th><th valign="top">% PIs with no opinion</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Involving members of a research group in peer review is a beneficial training exercise.</td><td>1.32&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03 <break/>(n&#160;=&#160;405)</td><td>1.54&#160;&#177;&#160;0.10 <break/>(n&#160;=&#160;81)</td><td>p=0.033</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">It is ethical for the invited reviewer (e.g. PI) to involve others (e.g. their trainees) in reviewing manuscripts.*</td><td>2.06&#160;&#177;&#160;0.06 <break/>(n&#160;=&#160;406)</td><td>2.37&#160;&#177;&#160;0.14 <break/>(n&#160;=&#160;81)</td><td>p=0.029</td><td>11</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">It would be valuable to have my name added to a peer review report (e.g. to be recognized as a co-reviewer by the editor; or to use a service such as Publons to be assigned credit).</td><td>1.71&#160;&#177;&#160;0.05 <break/>(n&#160;=&#160;405)</td><td>2.11&#160;&#177;&#160;0.13 <break/>(n&#160;=&#160;81)</td><td>p=0.003</td><td>10</td><td>21</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Indicates that p value was calculated assuming equal variance according to Levene&#8217;s test for Equality of Variances.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
