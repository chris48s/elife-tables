For their sequencing, extension products were eluted from templates, and full-length products were gel-purified, ligated to adaptor, reverse-transcribed and PCR amplified. For compositional analysis, a small percentage of unrelated amplified products were excluded (those with&#160;&gt;9 mutations vs. the expected &#946;<sup>+</sup> sequence; similar levels were excluded if a&#160;&gt;&#160;6 mutation threshold was applied, 0.2%/0.2&#8211;3.7%/4.2% and 3.7%/3.8% for tri &amp; <sup>ppp</sup>NNN and low-G <sup>ppp</sup>NNN). These sequences mostly appeared to derive from off-target priming and extension of F&#946;6 on the ribozyme in the presence of <sup>ppp</sup>NNN. The sequencing of products generated from specific triplets provides an estimate of background error arising from amplification and sequencing. The final triplet constitutes an error hot-spot - likely to mutate to a more mutationally stable triplet during self-replication - exacerbated in <sup>ppp</sup>NNN samples by the inability of the fidelity domain to operate in the absence of a downstream triplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8&#8212;figure supplement 3</xref>). The geometric average of internal triplet position fidelities is used to gauge overall t5<sup>+1</sup> fidelity during RNA synthesis. While overall fidelity drops from defined to random triplets (98.8 to 96.7%), much of this loss in fidelity can be recovered by adjusting the triplet composition to a low-G random pool, where reductions in G-U wobble pairing more than compensate for increases in rarer misincorporations opposite template C.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>G</th><th>C</th><th>C</th><th>A</th><th>U</th><th>C</th><th>A</th><th>A</th><th>A</th><th>G</th><th>C</th><th>U</th><th>U</th><th>G</th><th>A</th><th>G</th><th>A</th><th>G</th><th>C</th><th>A</th><th>U</th><th>C</th><th>U</th><th>U</th><th valign="top">Internal triplets&#8217; <break/>average:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6">10 &#956;M each tri:</td><td>93.3</td><td>99.4</td><td>99.5</td><td>97.8</td><td>99.8</td><td>99.4</td><td>99.6</td><td>97.9</td><td>99.1</td><td>99.3</td><td>99.5</td><td>99.1</td><td>99.8</td><td>98.9</td><td>99.5</td><td>98.2</td><td>96.0</td><td>96.3</td><td>98.79</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">10 &#956;M each <sup>PPP</sup>NNN:</td><td>92.8</td><td>97.0</td><td>98.8</td><td>99.2</td><td>99.5</td><td>99.3</td><td>99.1</td><td>97.8</td><td>98.6</td><td>99.4</td><td>99.1</td><td>98.7</td><td>94.3</td><td>81.4</td><td>96.6</td><td>97.4</td><td>59.8</td><td>42.3</td><td>96.65</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">10 &#956;M average, low-G <sup>PPP</sup>NNN:</td><td>97.3</td><td>98.2</td><td>99.5</td><td>97.3</td><td>99.7</td><td>99.4</td><td>99.6</td><td>97.8</td><td>99.0</td><td>99.3</td><td>98.9</td><td>98.8</td><td>97.6</td><td>97.3</td><td>98.8</td><td>97.4</td><td>73.2</td><td>43.2</td><td>98.56</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
