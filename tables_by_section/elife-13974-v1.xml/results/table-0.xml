Pyrosequencing detected low frequencies of G151 and N151 in some clinical samples.</td></tr><tr><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td>Pyrosequencing of 150 isolates after 1-4 passages in MDCK cells found that 85% developed mixed populations at site 151; 29% did so after a single passage. Mixed populations consisted of D+N, D+G, D+G+N, and D+G+A genotypes. T148I/K/P mutations were also observed in 23% of isolates.</td></tr><tr><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td>77 clinical specimens were Sanger-sequenced before and after a single passage in MDCK cells. 18 acquired a mutation at NA site 151: 10 were D+N, 7 were D+G and one fixed D151N at the limit of detection. No mutations were detected in the unpassaged specimens.</td></tr><tr><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chambers et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td>9 A/Victoria/361/11-like clinical specimens were passaged twice in MDCK cells and Sanger-sequenced before and after expansion. 4 isolates developed NA-dependent cell binding; 3 had D151G, the other D151N.</td></tr><tr><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mishin et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td>Pyrosequencing of 150 MDCK-grown isolates found that 42 were D+G, 34 were D+N, and 57 were D+G+N. Pyrosequencing of 50 matched clinical specimens detected no variation at site 151.</td></tr><tr><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mohr et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td>16 pairs of isolates cultured in parallel in MDCK cells and in eggs were sequenced using Ion Torrent. 5 MDCK isolates were D+N, 4 were D+G, and 2 were D+N+G. No egg-passaged isolates had mutations at site 151. T148I/K mutations were observed in 7 MDCK isolates.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
