K<sub>1</sub>&#160;+K<sub>2</sub> was also determined as the sum of the amplitudes of the two faster exponential components observed in the ACFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). It was assumed that in both N* and N**, the fluorescence of the Atto 655 dye moiety is fully quenched by PET. The errors shown represent the standard deviations determined from at least two independent experiments.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>(K<sub>1</sub>&#160;+&#160;K<sub>2</sub>) calculated from fluorescence spectra</th><th>(K<sub>1</sub>&#160;+&#160;K<sub>2</sub>) obtained from ACFs of PET-FCS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>W144/C199-Atto moPrP</td><td>1.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2</td><td>2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5</td></tr><tr><td>W171/C225-Atto moPrP</td><td>0.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2</td><td>0.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
