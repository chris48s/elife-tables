Genotypic predictors measured using two polygenic scores (PGS) built using only genome-wide significant SNPs (GWAS sig PGS) or all education associated SNPs (all SNP PGS) from the largest GWAS of educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Parental educational attainment (EA) was measured as average completed years of education. Parental socioeconomic position (SEP) was measured as highest parental score on the Cambridge Social Stratification Score scale.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">Achievement age 7</th><th valign="bottom">Achievement 16</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">GWAS sig PGS</td><td valign="bottom">0.17</td><td valign="bottom">0.19</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">All SNP PGS</td><td valign="bottom">0.26</td><td valign="bottom">0.37</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Mothers EA</td><td valign="top">0.28</td><td valign="top">0.39</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Fathers EA</td><td valign="top">0.27</td><td valign="top">0.40</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Parents SEP</td><td valign="bottom">0.30</td><td valign="bottom">0.40</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
