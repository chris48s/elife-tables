MRI-proven new intracranial bleeding event or infarct data are missing for 15 subjects (6 Placebo, 7 Aspirin 81 mg, 2 Aspirin 1000 mg) because they either died (four placebo, 6 aspirin 81 mg, 1 aspirin 1000 mg), were lost to follow-up before day 60 (1 placebo), or they were too unwell to have scans within 60&#160;&#177;&#160;10 days (two placebo, 1 aspirin 81 mg, 2 aspirin 1000 mg). A participant was excluded from the analysis of the combined primary safety endpoint if they had missing data for both gastro-intestinal bleeding event and MRI-proven intracranial bleeding event, or if information about one event type is missing and the other event type did not occur (i.e. participants for which it is unclear due to missing data whether the combined event occurred or not are excluded to avoid under-estimation of the true safety risk).</p><p><sup>&#8224;</sup>18* 18 participants (6 Placebo, 9 Aspirin 81 mg, 3 Aspirin 1000 mg) did not have MRI information at either baseline (&#177;7 days) or day 60 (&#177;10 days). For death status, the patient lost to follow-up after 57 days was treated as being alive. Patients were excluded from the combined primary efficacy endpoint if they were alive but MRI information was missing. One patient (Placebo) had both a new MRI-proven brain infarction event and death.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
