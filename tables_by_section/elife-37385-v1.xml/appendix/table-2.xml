The order of preference was determined based on both how frequently the method was used in previous studies and by taking into account the (expected) performance of each of the methods. First, higher order of preference was assigned to methods specifically designed for inferring linear dominance hierarchies (i.e. David&#8217;s score, I and SI, Landau&#8217;s and Kendall&#8217;s linearity indices). We used the information available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">S&#225;nchez-T&#243;jar et al., 2018b</xref> to rank David&#8217;s score and I and SI as first and second methods in preference, respectively. Second, we ranked the remaining (proportion-based) methods based on how frequently they were used in previous studies. Importantly, the order of preference was chosen prior to conducting any statistical analysis, and thus, method selection was blind to the outcome of the analyses.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
