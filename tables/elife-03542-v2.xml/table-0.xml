Percentages refer to the number of cells for which information increased when the specified metric was included in addition to those listed in rows above. Note that for velocity, phase and peer prediction, only those cells for which prediction performance improved with information about location were considered. Simulations demonstrate that, after taking into account place fields, velocity modulation factors and phase fields, information about peer activity improves prediction for the majority of cells when coordination is present, but not when cells are independent. Experimental data are consistent with independent coding.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
