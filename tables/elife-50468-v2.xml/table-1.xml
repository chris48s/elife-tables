Models were fitted on the log-odds scale with a logit link function, hence prior distributions are shown as log-odds. Posterior parameter distributions have been transformed using the logistic function and are shown as probabilities. Prior distributions are normal distributions, shown in brackets are the mean and standard deviation respectively.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th>Risk Factor Model</th><th>Parameters</th><th>Priors</th><th>Posterior Median <break/>(95% CrI)<sup>*</sup></th><th>WAIC<sup>&#8224;</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>(A) Single intercept <break/>Standard covariates<sup>&#8225;</sup> <break/>96 hour antibiotic exposure</td><td>&#945; (intercept) <break/>&#946; (slopes)</td><td>normal(0, 10) <break/>normal(0, 5)</td><td>0.23 (0.055, 0.60) <break/>ORs<sup>&#167;</sup> in results</td><td>438</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(B) Single intercept <break/>Standard covariates<sup>&#8225;</sup> <break/>48 hour antibiotic exposure</td><td>&#945; (intercept) <break/>&#946; (slopes)</td><td>normal(0, 10) <break/>normal(0, 5)</td><td>0.26 (0.068, 0.63) <break/>Not shown</td><td>441</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(C) Single intercept <break/>Standard covariates<sup>&#8225;</sup> + <break/>colonisation pressure term<sup>&#182;</sup> <break/>96 hour antibiotic exposure</td><td>&#945; (intercept) <break/>&#946; (slopes)</td><td>normal(0, 10) <break/>normal(0, 5)</td><td>0.26 (0.059, 0.64) <break/>Not shown</td><td>440</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(D) Intercept varies by month <break/>Standard covariates<sup>&#8225;</sup> <break/>96 hour antibiotic exposure</td><td>&#945;[month] (intercept) <break/>&#956; (normal mean) <break/>&#963; (normal standard de- <break/>viation) <break/>&#946; (slopes)</td><td>normal(&#956;, &#963;) <break/>normal(0, 3) <break/>half-normal(0, 1) <break/>normal(0, 3)</td><td>Varies by month<sup>&#8224;&#8224;</sup> <break/>0.21 (0.044, 0.57) <break/>0.54 (0.51, 0.63) <break/>Not shown</td><td>440</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup> 95% Credible interval. <sup>&#8224;</sup>&#160;Widely applicable information criterion (a model comparison statistic where lower values indicate better fitting models). <sup>&#8225;</sup> Standard covariates: use of ampicillin, ampicillin + gentamicin, cloxacillin (oral), ceftriaxone, cloxacillin + gentamicin, and imipenem within the previous 48 or 96 hours; whether breast fed; receipt of an oral probiotic on entry (<italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>), sex, premature (born before the 37th week of pregnancy), severity (defined as severe if requiring ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure or inotopes), already colonised with 3GC-R <italic>E. coli</italic>, age in days on first admission to the NU, and the daily number of nurses on the ward.
