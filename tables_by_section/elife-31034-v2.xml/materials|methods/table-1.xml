Post-hoc, we performed further analysis to investigate whether the other measures (listed in the above table) show similar effects to the high-gamma peak to trough. As shown here, all of the measures show a significant increase following stimulation (second column) whereas they do not show a significant change after control sessions in which there is no stimulation applied (first column). However, other measures are more variable and do not show increases relative to the control sessions (third column). Furthermore, only high-gamma peak to trough and broadband amplitude are significantly correlated with coherence in the baseline condition (fourth column). Overall, this suggests that the amplitude of the high-gamma signal is the best of these metrics for estimating connectivity. All effect sizes in this table reflect the median change in connectivity across sessions for each measure; p-values reflect the output of signrank (columns 1 and 2) and ranksum (column 3) statistical tests.</p><p><supplementary-material id="table2scode1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31034.038</object-id><label>Table 2&#8212;source code 1.</label><caption><title>Statistics of SERR and other connectivity measures for each session in each experimental condition.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31034-table2-code1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="table2sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31034.039</object-id><label>Table 2&#8212;source data 1.</label><caption><title>SERR and other connectivity measures for each session in each experimental condition.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31034-table2-data1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Evoked Response Measure</th><th>Change in Connectivity during Control Sessions</th><th>Change in Connectivity during Long Latency Stim Sessions</th><th>Change in Connectivity in Control Sessions Vs.
