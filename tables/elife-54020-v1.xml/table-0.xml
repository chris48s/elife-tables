The ethogram is restricted to wild rats under natural or semi-natural conditions.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Behaviour</th><th>Sex</th><th>Description</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="12">Socio-positive</td><td>Allogrooming</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual gently nibbles or licks the fur of a conspecific, sometimes with the aid of its forepaws. All body parts of the partner may be cleaned including the tail.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref>, p. 77</td></tr><tr><td>Huddling</td><td>Females and males</td><td>Rats lie together with direct body contact, sometimes sleeping.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Barnett and Spencer, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Inspecting anogenital region</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual sniffs or licks the anogenital region of a conspecific, probably used in the context of recognition.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref>, p. 64</td></tr><tr><td>Nosing</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual gently pushes another&#8217;s flank or neck with its nose.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref>, p. 77</td></tr><tr><td>Nose-touching</td><td>Females and males</td><td>Two individuals approach each other until their noses come into contact. This possibly serves recognition and may result in socio-positive or negative behaviours.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Calhoun, 1979</xref>, p. 179</td></tr><tr><td>Oral inspection</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual sniffs at a conspecific&#8217;s mouth. This is most common between mothers and their offspring, but takes place between adults, too.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Calhoun, 1979</xref>, p. 149</td></tr><tr><td>Pioneering</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual leaves the burrow vigilantly and observes the surroundings for several minutes. Only then will other colony members appear from the burrow.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Barnett and Spencer, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib232">Telle, 1966</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Play fighting</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual attacks the nape of its opponent, which the latter tries to defend. Play fights take place only during adolescence.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ewer, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Calhoun, 1979</xref>, p. 180</td></tr><tr><td>Recognition sniffing</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual shows enhanced sniffing at colony members and (potentially marked) objects, especially if a stranger entered its territory.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Barnett, 1967</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Scent marking</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual rubs the flanks or presses the anogenital region on a surface, sometimes leaving urine droplets on the surface.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Landete-Castillejos, 1997</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Sharing food</td><td>Females and males</td><td>An individual tolerates a conspecific in its close proximity, sometimes even touching each other, while feeding from the same food resource. Alternatively, one individual drops small food items that can be taken by another. Further, residues in the face or on the paws of an individual can be licked off by another.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Barnett and Spencer, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref>, p. 36; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Calhoun, 1979</xref>, p. 101</td></tr><tr><td>Submissive posture</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual lies on its side with eyes half-closed. This posture is used to &#8216;greet&#8217; more dominant individuals to prevent fights. Sometimes this posture is combined with &#8216;crawling under&#8217; (see below).</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Barnett, 1967</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="13">Socio-negative</td><td>Aggressive grooming</td><td>Mostly males</td><td>One individual pins down a conspecific forcefully while allogrooming it. This is often accompanied by squeaks and run-away attempts of the groomed partner.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Barnett, 2001</xref>, p. 131</td></tr><tr><td>Avoiding</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual changes its route upon detecting another rat.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Calhoun, 1979</xref>, p. 179</td></tr><tr><td>Boxing</td><td>Mostly males</td><td>Bouts of fights are typically intermitted by standing upright to box. While boxing, they hit and scratch each other&#8217;s face, which is accompanied with raised hair and ears pointing forward.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Chasing</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual runs after a second. This usually precedes fights but can also take place afterwards.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Calhoun, 1979</xref>, p. 181</td></tr><tr><td>Crawling under/walking over</td><td>Mostly males</td><td>One rat crawls under, that&#160;is typically the subordinate, or walks over a conspecific, that&#160;is typically the more dominant.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Direct approach</td><td>Mostly males</td><td>An individual approaches an opponent to attack, often accompanied with urination and defecation and raised hair. Sometimes the individual shows tooth chattering while approaching.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Fighting</td><td>Mostly males</td><td>Two rats tumble, roll over the ground while holding, kicking and punching each other.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Calhoun, 1979</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Leaping and biting</td><td>Mostly males</td><td>The attacker jumps towards the opponent with extended forelimbs and tries to bite usually its ears, limb or tail. Bites are typically very quick.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Passage guarding</td><td>Probably only males</td><td>One more dominant individual stands in a passage and therefore blocks the way of a second. The opponent typically waits until the first moves away or takes a detour.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Calhoun, 1979</xref>, p. 187</td></tr><tr><td>Pushing away</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual pushes another with its forepaws or flank to move a conspecific from its current position. Sometimes pushes are accompanied with kicks or swinging the body towards the opponent.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Calhoun, 1979</xref>, p. 101</td></tr><tr><td>Tail quivering</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual quivers its tail, which might be shown in various situations like during &#8216;crawling under&#8217; or shortly before copulation.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib224">Steininger, 1950</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Threat posture</td><td>Mostly males</td><td>An attacker adopts a posture where the back is maximally arched, all limbs are extended, and the flank is turned to its opponent.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Tooth-chattering</td><td>Females and males</td><td>One individual chatters with its teeth while staying immobile, most common after detecting an opponent.</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barnett, 1963</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
