The empirical p-values for the proportion of pre- and post-pairs were calculated using simulated permutations (see Materials&#160;and&#160;methods section). A participant is fully represented in a given cluster if both their pre- and post-challenge time series of measurements are contained in the cluster. Partial representation corresponds to the scenario in which only one of the two time series (pre- and post-challenge) is a member of the cluster. See also the Materials&#160;and&#160;methods section for the definition of neighbors.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Characteristic \ cluster number</th><th valign="bottom">Cluster 1</th><th valign="bottom">Cluster 2</th><th valign="bottom">Cluster 3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Size (%)</td><td valign="bottom">4 (8.33 %)</td><td valign="bottom">26 (54.17 %)</td><td valign="bottom">18 (37.50 %)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Fully represented healthy participants</td><td valign="bottom">0</td><td valign="bottom">11</td><td valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Partially represented healthy participants</td><td valign="bottom">0</td><td valign="bottom">0</td><td valign="bottom">0</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Fully represented asthmatic participants</td><td valign="bottom">1</td><td valign="bottom">2</td><td valign="bottom">7</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Partially represented asthmatic participants</td><td valign="bottom">2</td><td valign="bottom">0</td><td valign="bottom">2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Number of time series from healthy participants (%)</td><td valign="bottom">0 (0%)</td><td valign="bottom">22 (84.62 %)</td><td valign="bottom">2 (11.11 %)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">p-value of enrichment/depletion in time series from healthy participants</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>0.055</italic></td><td valign="bottom"><bold>1.09E-07</bold></td><td valign="bottom"><italic>2.89E-05</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Number of neighboring pre- and post-pairs (%)</td><td valign="bottom">1 (33.33 %)</td><td valign="bottom">5 (38.46 %)</td><td valign="bottom">1 (10 %)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Empirical p-value (probability of observing, <break/>under the null hypothesis, the number of neighboring pre- and post-pairs found in the data, as listed in the previous row above)</td><td valign="bottom">0.123</td><td valign="bottom">0.001</td><td valign="bottom">0.424</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
