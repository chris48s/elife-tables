Not affected by specific manipulations to reward or time.</td><td>Rats will follow qualitative predictions of the Marginal Value Theorem, but exhibit an equal degree of overharvesting across conditions in each experiment.</td></tr><tr><td>Nonlinear Reward Utility</td><td>Subjective value increases sublinear to reward magnitude. Predicts greater overharvesting with steeper utility functions with larger rewards.</td><td>Rats will exhibit an equal degree of ovarharvesting in all experiments except for the Scale experiment. In the Scale experiment, rats will overharvest more in the conditions with larger rewards.</td></tr><tr><td>Biased Time Perception</td><td>i) Post-reward delays perceived as shorter, ii) pre-reward delays perceived as longer, or iii) longer delays (irrespective of their placement) perceived as shorter. All three hypotheses predict greater overharvesting with longer delays.</td><td>Rats will exhibit a greater degree of overharvesting in the condition with longer delays in the Scale environment, in the condition with the longer post-reward delay in the Pre-vs-Post experiment, and in the condition with longer post-reward delay in the Post-Reward Delay experiment</td></tr><tr><td>Temporal Discounting</td><td>Value of future rewards discounted due to delay to receive them. Predicts greater overharvesting with greater levels of discounting and with longer delays</td><td>Rats will overharvest to a greater degree in the conditions with longer delays in the Scale and Post-Reward Delay experiments and they will leave patches earlier due to the longer pre-reward delay in the Pre-vs-Post experiment.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
