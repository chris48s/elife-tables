Third instar larvae derived from heterozygous parents were treated with the indicated concentration of MMS and the surviving adult progeny were scored. % Obs represents the total percentage of adults of the indicated mutant genotype divided by the total number of adults scored. % of expected progeny represents the percentage of mutant adults observed (% Obs) divided by the expected percentage of mutant adults based on the parental cross. For <italic>nprl2</italic>, which is on the X chromosome, the expected percentage of mutant progeny was 50%. For <italic>nprl3</italic>, which is on the 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome, the expected percentage of mutant progeny was 33.3%. The observation that <italic>nprl2</italic> and <italic>nprl3</italic> have a lower percent survival than would be predicted at 0% MMS reflects the fact that these mutants are partially lethal in the absence of mutagen.</p><p>Obs.=Observed, # of Obs&#160;=&#160;Number of mutant adults scored, # of Total&#160;=&#160;Total number of adults scored.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
