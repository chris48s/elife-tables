The appointment process is initiated by the department, but it is then reviewed in the Provost&#8217;s Office, the Office of Academic Affairs and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs to ensure that the terms of the appointment provide appropriate benefits and equitable opportunities for career development. All postdocs are evaluated annually for reappointment to the position, and these requests are reviewed and approved through the same process.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="3" valign="top">University of Chicago &#8211; two postdoc designations &#8211; one common experience</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">&#8195;Position</th><th valign="top">POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW</th><th valign="top">POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">&#8195;Stipend</td><td valign="top">Extramural, e.g. fellowship</td><td valign="top">Institutional (including from grants)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&#8195;Benefits</td><td valign="top">&#8220;Supplemental stipend&#8221; from institution to provide benefits equivalent to Postdoctoral Scholar</td><td valign="top">&#8220;Special employee&#8221; receives benefits from institution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&#8195;Career Development</td><td valign="top">Follow criteria outlined in terms of the fellowship</td><td valign="top">Institutionally mandated to provide similar career development experience</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
