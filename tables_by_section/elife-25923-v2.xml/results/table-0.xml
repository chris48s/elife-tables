have fears and concerns; highly socially driven; have mostly no social support for VMMC.</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Highly Resistant</bold></td><td>Weak motivation</td><td>Strong rejection</td><td>Strong ability</td><td>Highly socially driven</td><td>No fears</td><td valign="top">Weak motivation, rejection of VMMC; mostly negative beliefs about VMMC; relatively higher risk of HIV/STI contraction; however, level of concern about HIV/STIs contraction is low; are not open to information and feel that they know all they need about VMMC; claim absence of fear; very socially driven; mostly highly rejecting VMMC social environment.</td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="8">Table 1B &#8211;

high level of concern about contraction of HIV/STIs; believe in majority of benefits, emotionally associate VMMC with sense of belonging feel that they are independent from social environment in their decision to go for VMMC; but are very actively supported by all people around; control cognitive dissonance; have some minor fears.</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Self-reliant believers</bold></td><td>Strong motivation</td><td>Average confidence</td><td>Strong ability</td><td>Somewhat socially driven</td><td>Strong fears</td><td>Strong motivation; believe in the benefits of VMMC, tend to value the benefits for sexual relationships; emotionally associate VMMC with a feeling of closeness to their partner; less socially supported, which makes them slightly less confident in themselves; feel some cognitive dissonance, but presence of fears doesn&#8217;t make them doubt in necessity of VMMC; feel strong ability to go for VMMC, don&#8217;t require additional information.</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Knowledgeable Hesitant</bold></td><td>Neutral</td><td>Strong confidence</td><td>Lack of ability</td><td>Somewhat socially driven</td><td>No fears</td><td>Somewhat motivated to go for VMMC, mostly because of HIV/STI protection; also value benefits for sexual life, considering that circumcised men are more desired by women; riskier sexual behavior; quite strong concerns about possible negative consequences of VMMC, which make them hesitate (e.g. safety of the procedure; loss of sensitivity, increase of promiscuity).</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Friends-Driven Hesitant</bold></td><td>Neutral</td><td>Lack of confidence</td><td>Lack of ability</td><td>Somewhat socially driven</td><td>No fears</td><td>Ambivalent attitude toward circumcision: not completely rejecting circumcision, but also don't have strong motivation; less risky sexually, mostly focused on hygiene benefit; social environment also has two directions (supporting and inhibiting); lack of assurance in the need of VMMC; however, don&#8217;t have any serious personal constraints.</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Scared Rejecters</bold></td><td>Weak motivation</td><td>Average confidence</td><td>Lack of ability</td><td>Fully independent</td><td>Strong fears</td><td>Mostly negative attitude to VMMC; negative beliefs in possible complications, doubts in safety of the procedure; experience cognitive dissonance; don&#8217;t completely reject the benefits of VMMC, but the protection of infections is less relevant for them; mainly believe in the hygiene benefit and help for sons to be circumcised.</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Indifferent Rejecters</bold></td><td>Weak motivation</td><td>Strong confidence</td><td>Strong ability</td><td>Somewhat socially driven</td><td>Some fears</td><td>The least educated and least knowledgeable of VMMC; are generally not concerned about HIV and other infections; attitude to VMMC is ambivalent; relatively socially driven; not strongly supported by social environment.</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Traditional Believers</bold></td><td>Neutral</td><td>Strong confidence</td><td>Lack of ability</td><td>Very socially driven</td><td>Some fears</td><td>Mostly circumcised or have a high level of commitment to VMMC; however rather poor knowledge about the benefits and belief in them; the proportion of men circumcised for religious/traditional reasons is the highest; the key benefit of circumcision is maintenance of tradition in the family, helping sons to get circumcised.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The table summarizes the differences among segments based on the key factors identified via canonical correlations analysis.
