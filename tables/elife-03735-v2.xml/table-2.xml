The SC-Lys and SC-His experiments were carried out by JG, and used flash-freezing as the initial method for stopping ribosome movement. The YPD1 and YPD2 experiments were carried out by YC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai and Futcher, 2013</xref>), and used addition of ice and cycloheximide to the culture as the initial method for stopping ribosome movement. The &#8216;Ingo&#8217; experiment was that carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ingolia et al. (2009)</xref>. Further details are given in &#8216;Materials and methods&#8217;.
