We sought to specifically avoid this in our survey questions by using the answers to the question &#8220;When you were not the invited reviewer, what was the extent of your involvement in the peer review process?&#8221; to disambiguate the grey areas of authorship. We consider any experience that began with &#8220;I read the manuscript, wrote a full report for my PI, and...&#8221; to be an unequivocally significant contribution deserving of authorship on the peer review report.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
