Report and case numbers identify two FAERS reports where the ADR is confused with the indication.</p><p>For the first case, rosiglitazone prescribed for diabetes (Indication) is identified as the primary suspect (PS) for causing diabetes mellitus as an ADR as well. In the second case, &#8216;cardiac failure congestive&#8217; is given as the indication for rosiglitazone with the reported ADR of &#8216;cardiac failure congestive&#8217;. The third case exemplifies correct reporting, where both the ADR and the indication of rosiglitazone are reported correctly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25818.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25818.006</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Report</th><th>Case</th><th>ADR</th><th>Drug / Role / Indication</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&#8195;6545021</td><td>179039</td><td>Diabetes mellitus</td><td>Rosiglitazone/PS/Diabetes mellitus</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;5521616</td><td>162007</td><td>Cardiac failure congestive</td><td>Rosiglitazone/PS/Cardiac failure congestive</td></tr><tr><td>&#8195;6380841</td><td>7085373</td><td>Cardiac failure congestive</td><td>Rosiglitazone/PS/Diabetes mellitus</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
