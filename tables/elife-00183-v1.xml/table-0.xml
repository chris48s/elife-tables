A large fluorescent inclusion detected within 30 s or less was considered to be a wound-related tubulin entry into TB. In roughly half the experiments using infected tissue, rapid formation of large fluorescent inclusions was observed; in the other experiments, either no reaction occurred or formation of diffuse fluorescent clouds prevailed. In healthy controls, most cells responded with the appearance of diffuse tubulin clouds, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardham et al., 2008</xref>); rapid appearance of tubulin inclusions was never observed.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
