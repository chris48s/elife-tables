We have modified our wording as follows: <break/>&#8220;We found that Metformin treatment increased the abundance of many AA in GRU102, with Alanine, Glycine, Proline and Serine consistently increased in both replicates (Figure 5D, Figure 5&#8212;figure supplement 1).&#8221;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Figure 5E</td><td valign="top">Metformin significantly increased levels of C3-acylcarnitine and also C5-acylcarnitine, even though the latter did not reach statistical significance.</td><td valign="top">Levels of C3-acylcarnitine appear similar between Metformin-treated and untreated GRU102. Metformin also appears to reduce the levels of C5-acylcarnitine, even though the reduction did not reach statistical significance.</td><td valign="top">Given the different trends observed in the two replicates, we feel that the increase in C3-acylcarnitine originally observed was within the noise of the measurement, and hence has removed its discussion in the manuscript.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
