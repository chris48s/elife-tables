Neurons were redrawn and the central analysis (computing subspaces etc.) was performed again for the redrawn population. This process was repeated 1000 times, and the relevant measure was made, yielding a sampling distribution of 1000 values. P-values were based on these sampling distributions.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Monkey ba</th><th valign="top">Monkey ax</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Prep. occ. declines before movement onset. <break/>(150 ms before vs. 150 ms after <break/>move onset, cue-initiated)</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Target-driven rise in prep. occ. <break/>is smaller for self- vs. cue-initiated <break/>(compared 150 ms after target onset)</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Self-initiated prep. occ. remains <break/>above baseline after post-target peak <break/>(400 ms post-target vs 150 ms pre-target)</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Self-initiated prep. occ. grows as <break/>movement approaches <break/>(150 ms before move onset vs <break/>150 ms after target onset)</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Prep. occ. before movement onset <break/>is similar but slightly different for <break/>self- and cue-initiated contexts <break/>(assessed 150 ms before move onset)</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.003 <break/>(larger for self-)</td><td valign="top">N.S. <break/>(smaller for self-)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Prep. occ. rises above baseline <break/>in the quasi-automatic context</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pre-movement peak in prep. occ. <break/>is modestly higher for quasi-automatic <break/>context versus other two contexts</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.002 for both comparisons</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.002 for both comparisons</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Prep. occ. precedes move. occ <break/>. even for quasi-automatic context <break/>(compare latency to cross threshold set to 10% of peak)</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td><td valign="top">p&lt;0.001</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
