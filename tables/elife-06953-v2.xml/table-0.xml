Firing frequency was calculated for the entire pulse as the number of spikes divided by the pulse duration (F<sub>total</sub>). Three instantaneous discharge frequencies were also calculated: (1) between the first pair of spikes (F<sub>initial</sub>); (2) at 200 ms from the beginning of the pulse (F<sub>200</sub>); and (3) at the end of the pulse (F<sub>final</sub>). These values were used to quantify both early and late accommodations in accordance with the following formulas: (F<sub>initial</sub> &#8722; F<sub>200</sub>/F<sub>initial</sub>) and (F<sub>200</sub> &#8722; F<sub>final</sub>/F<sub>initial</sub>), respectively. We also dissected the spike morphology from action potentials elicited by 80-ms suprathreshold pulses from &#8722;70 mV (150&#8211;200 pA). From these recordings, the spike threshold corresponded to the voltage at which the derivative of the AP (dV/dt) experienced a twofold increase. The amplitudes, the first and the second AP (A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>), were calculated from the threshold to peak. Their duration (D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>) corresponded to the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) from a Gaussian fit of the depolarized face of the AP immediately after the threshold. Both amplitude reduction and duration increase were calculated by the formulas A<sub>1</sub> &#8722; A<sub>2</sub>/A<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> &#8722; D<sub>1</sub>/D<sub>1</sub>, respectively. The amplitude of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) was calculated as the difference between the threshold and the peak of the fast hyperpolarization. We also estimated the AHP width as the FWHM and the latency of AP peak to AHP trough. We extracted the positive and negative peaks from the derivative of the AP waveform to quantify the maximal speed excursion of the membrane voltage during both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing faces of the AP. Finally, the input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was measured in current clamp by applying hyperpolarizing pulses from &#8722;60 mV (&#8722;200 pA). The three major parameters to differentiate FSI from NFSI appeared in bold. Note that seven other parameters also easily differentiate these interneurons. NS: no significant difference.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
